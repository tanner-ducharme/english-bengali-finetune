## Instructions for running our code

### Seq2Seq models

### Gemma models
The Gemma notebook for our bes experiment is `gemma7b - best experiment.ipynb`
it's best run on google colab as a notebook, but a python file version has been made available (although you might have to tweak to get it to work with your GPU)

The notebooks from our other experiments can be found in `/other notebooks/`, but these have not been fully cleaned and/or commented

### BLEU score
the script we used to calculate BLEU score is `name`

### Visualizations
All graphs were generated using tensorboard. The tensorboard files are automatically created in the `results/exp_name/runs/` folder
